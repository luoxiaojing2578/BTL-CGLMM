# BTL-CGLMM
BTL-CGLMM (Bayesian Transfer Learning under Compositional Generalized Linear Mixed Model) is developed to address microbiome data, which are typically characterized by high dimensionality, small sample sizes, and compositional constraints. This package provides model function code and simulation experiment analysis code for both the BTL-CGLMM and Adaptive BTL-CGLMM, for both continuous and binary outcomes. The code files are organized into two separate folders, namely "Continuous" and "Binary", corresponding to the two outcome types respectively.
